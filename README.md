# Key Features
# Formspree Integration:

The form uses the action attribute with a URL provided by Formspree (https://formspree.io/f/mkgnavwj), which handles the form submission.
The method="POST" ensures data is sent securely.
Form Fields:

# The form includes three fields:
Title (Name): A simple text input field.
Email: A dedicated email input field (type="email") for validation.
Message: A textarea for longer feedback.
All fields are marked required, ensuring users cannot submit an empty form.
# Styling:

Inline styles are used for all components for quick customization.
Form elements are styled for readability and usability, with features like borderRadius, padding, and marginBottom.
Submission Button:

The button for form submission is styled but commented out, making the form non-functional unless these styles are uncommented or replaced.
